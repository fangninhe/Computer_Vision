# Multi-View Geometry and 3D Computer Vision
In this space, everything is about multi-view geometry and 3D computer vision.  
I've been always using C++ for my work and reasearch. However, considering this space is mainly used for reviewing each part of multi-view geometry and 3D computer vision, All testing code is demonstrated in Jupyter notebook. Then, one can easily check it in the browser.
