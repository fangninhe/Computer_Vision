# Multi-View Geometry and 3D Computer Vision
In this space, everything is about multi-view geometry and 3D computer vision.  
I've been always using C++ for photogrammetry and computer vision-related reasearch. However, considering this space is mainly a review of each part in multi-view geometry and 3D computer vision, Juptyer Notebook is selected and all testing code is demonstrated in python. Then, one can easily check it in the browser.
