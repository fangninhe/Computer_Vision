    "# Homogeneous Coordinates in 2D\n",
    "This chapter introduces the representation of points, lines, and conics with houmogeneous notations in 2D space.  In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. Homogeneous coordinates based representation for geometric entities lead to compact formulas (and easy to program) for many useful operations on the entities."

    "## Homogeneous Representation of Lines and Points\n",
    "In the 2D space of reals ($i.e.,\\ {\\rm I\\!R}^2$), a line in the plane can be represented by an equation such as $ax+by+c=0$, in which different coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ give rise to different lines. Intuitively, such a line equation lead to a vector representation as $(a, b, c)^T$. However, the relationship between lines and vectors $(a, b, c)^T$ is not a one-to-one correspondence, since the lines $ax+by+c=0$ and $(ka)x+(kb)y+(kc)=0$ are always the same, for any non-zero $k$. In fact, two such vectors related by an overall scaling are considered as being equivalent. An equivalent class of vectors under this equivalence relationship is known as a homogeneous vector. Any particular vector $(a, b, c)^T$ is a representative of the equivalence class for a line $\\textbf{l}$.\n",
    "$$\\textbf{l}=\\begin{bmatrix}a \\\\ b \\\\ c\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "A point $x=(x, y)$ lies on the line $\\textbf{l}=(a, b, c)^T$ if and only if $ax+by+c=0$. Given the representation of a 2D point $(x, y)$ by adding a final coordinate of 1 (i.e., a 3-by-1 vector $\\textbf{x}=(x, y, 1)^T$), the line function can be re-written as a dot product of two vectors:\n",
    "$$ax+by+c=\\textbf{l}^T\\textbf{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}a & b & c\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "In this regard, we can state that $\\textbf{x}=(x, y, 1)^T$ is the homogeneous coordinates of the point $(x, y)$ in ${\\rm I\\!R}^2$. Exploring the 3D representational space ${\\rm I\\!R}^3$, we note that all the points $k(x, y, 1)^T$ with $k\\neq{0}$ form an equivalent class that represents the same physical point $(x, y)$ in ${\\rm I\\!R}^2$ space. Therefore, an arbitrary homogeneous vector representation of a point with the form $\\textbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$ represents the point $(x_1/x_3, x_2/x_3)^T$ in ${\\rm I\\!R}^2$."
